	> alex.m is an Octave script to treat experimental data from the ALEX setup.

	> it takes the electrical signals and extracts the electrical energy from them.

	> also uses streak images to obtain radius expansion data in function of time, 
		and from there take out the kinetic energy of the expansion.

	> alex.m output text data are named with the "shot name"_magnitude.txt convention.

	> alex.m output graphs are a quick review of the results.

	> to operate alex.m follow:
		-> Open Octave bash.
		-> Go to the folder with alex.m, baseline.m, chan.m, deri.m, 
			display_rounded_matrix.m, polyadj.m, supsmu.m, 
			the scope and the streak files from the shots.
		-> run alex.m. It will ask for the file name. 
		-> Wait for the results and you will obtain the output files.
